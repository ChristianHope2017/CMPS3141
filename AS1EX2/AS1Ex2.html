    <h1>Usability Problems and Solutions</h1>
    
    <h2>Learnability</h2>

    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>
        Clothes tags often hinder learnability by presenting information in a way that is difficult for users 
        to quickly understand. Tags may feature small, hard-to-read text or use unfamiliar symbols and 
        languages, making it challenging for users to easily find and interpret important details such as 
        care instructions, sizing, and fabric content. Additionally, tags placed at the back of the neck can 
        be itchy and uncomfortable, which can detract from the users overall experience and may lead to 
        irritation. This complexity and discomfort create a steep learning curve each time users encounter a 
        new garment, leading to confusion and frustration.
    </p>
 
    <h3>Solution</h3> 
    <p>
        To improve learnability, clothes tags should be designed with clear, legible text and universally 
        recognizable symbols. Using larger fonts and straightforward language, along with consistent and 
        simple symbols, can make it easier for users to access and understand essential information. 
        Additionally, to address the discomfort issue, tags should be placed in less irritating locations, 
        such as the side seam or lower hem, or be designed as tagless labels with printed information 
        directly on the garment. This approach not only enhances readability but also improves comfort, 
        allowing users to quickly learn and recall garment details without unnecessary difficulty or irritation.

    <h2>Efficiency</h2>

    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p> 
        Mirrors fogging up in the bath after a hot shower significantly impacts efficiency by obstructing the 
        reflection and making it difficult for users to perform grooming tasks. When a mirror is fogged, users 
        may have to wait several minutes for the steam to dissipate or resort to additional steps to clear the 
        fog, such as wiping the mirror with a cloth or using a defogging spray. This added time and effort 
        disrupt the grooming routine, causing delays and reducing overall efficiency in completing daily tasks.
    </p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p> 
        To improve efficiency, mirrors can be treated with anti-fog coatings or designed with built-in defogging 
        technology. Anti-fog coatings prevent condensation from forming, ensuring a clear reflection immediately 
        after a hot shower. Additionally, heated mirrors or mirror defoggers, which warm the surface to prevent 
        fogging, can also be installed. These solutions eliminate the need for users to take extra steps to clear 
        the mirror, allowing them to proceed with their grooming routine quickly and efficiently.

    <h2>Safety</h2>

    <h3>Problem Description:</h3>
    <p> 
        Cup holders in vehicles can negatively impact safety when they are poorly designed or located. 
        For example, cup holders that are difficult to reach or place drinks in precarious positions can lead 
        to spills while driving, which can cause distractions or even result in hazardous conditions, such as 
        slippery surfaces. Additionally, cup holders that do not securely hold drinks may cause them to tip 
        over during sudden stops or turns, increasing the risk of spills that could distract the driver and 
        impair vehicle control.
    </p>

    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <p> 
        To enhance safety, vehicle cup holders should be designed with secure, adjustable features that 
        accommodate various drink sizes and shapes, minimizing the risk of spills. They should be positioned 
        in easily accessible locations that do not interfere with the drivers ability to operate the vehicle. 
        Additionally, incorporating non-slip materials or designs that stabilize the drink can help prevent 
        accidental tipping. By ensuring that cup holders are both functional and safely integrated into the 
        vehicles interior, drivers can avoid distractions and maintain better control, leading to a safer 
        driving experience.
